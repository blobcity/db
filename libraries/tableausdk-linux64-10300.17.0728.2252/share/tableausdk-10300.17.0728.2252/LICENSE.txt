You further acknowledge and agree as between you and Tableau that Tableau owns the Tableau and Software-related trademarks and all related trademarks, service marks, logos and other brand designations ("Tableau Marks"), and you agree to not seek to register (including as a domain name) or use any such Tableau Marks without Tableau’s advance written permissions. Any use you make of the Tableau Marks inures to Tableau’s benefit.

1.4	Third-Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of third-party “open source” software licenses (“Open Source Software”).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, Tableau and its suppliers have and will retain all rights, title and interest (including, without limitation, all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Software and all copies, modifications and derivative works thereof (including any changes which incorporate any of your ideas, feedback or suggestions). You acknowledge that you are obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or like terms hereunder no ownership rights are being conveyed to you under this Agreement or otherwise.  If you elect to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, ideas or other feedback to Tableau  related to the Software (collectively, “Feedback”), you agree that Tableau will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as Tableau sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind.
